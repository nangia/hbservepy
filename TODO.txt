====
remove dist and build directories in .bat files before making build

use logging 
hbserve.py:    # TODO: check that the tmp directory must exist
hbserve.py:    # TODO: in case auto load is on, print a warning
hbserve.py:    # TODO: rabbitmq should be configurable
pick url for connection to rabbitmq from config file
hbserve.py:# TODO: handle if pika connections are lost. connect again
hbserve.py:# TODO: same for client
hbserve.py:# TODO: put command line parameters to control configuration
hbserve.py:# TODO: make rabbitmq parameters to be picked from configuration
hbserve.py:# TODO: include requests to be installed. check if version same on windows. otherwise upgrade


make sure persistence of rabbitmq is tested. e.g. what if you shut down rabbitmq in between and then start again
